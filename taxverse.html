            <h1>What is Income Tax?</h1>
            <p>Income tax is a type of tax that the central government charges on the income earned during a financial year by the individuals and businesses. Taxes are sources of revenue for the government. Government utilizes this revenue for developing infrastructure, providing healthcare, education, subsidy to the farmer/agriculture sector and in other government welfare schemes. Taxes are mainly of two types, direct taxes and indirect form of taxes. Tax levied directly on the income earned is called as direct tax, for example Income tax is a direct tax. The tax calculation is based on the income slab rates applicable during that financial year.

                <br><br>Direct Taxes are broadly classified as :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Income Tax</b> – This is taxes an individual or a Hindu Undivided Family or any taxpayer other than companies, pay on the income received. The law prescribes the rate at which such income should be taxed</li>
                    <li><b>Corporate Tax</b> – This is the tax that companies pay on the profits they make from their businesses. Here again, a specific rate of tax for corporates has been prescribed by the income tax laws of India.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <br><br><br>
            <h1>Who should pay Income Tax? - Types of Income Tax Payers</h1>
            <p>The Income tax Act has classified the types of taxpayers in categories so as to apply different tax rates for different types of taxpayers.</p>
            <br><p>Taxpayers are categorized as below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Individuals</li>
                <li>Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)</li>
                <li>Association of Persons(AOP)</li>
                <li>Body of Individuals (BOI)</li>
                <li>Firms</li>
                <li>Companies</li>


            </ul>

            <p>Further, Individuals are broadly classified into residents and non-residents.Resident individuals are liable to pay tax on their global income in India i.e. income earned in India and abroad.

That’s incorrect. A person earning 12 lakhs in the progressive tax system, will pay Rs.1,12,500+ Rs.60,000 = Rs. 1,72,500.
