                <i class="fas fa-plus icon"></i>

            <div class="content">
                <p>E-Filing is mandatory in certain cases. For example, if your total income exceeds Rs. 5,00,000 p.a. or if you want to claim refund then you are compulsorily required to e-file your Income Tax Return. It is a much simpler process than filing a paper return and also your refunds are processed faster if your return has been E-Filed.</p>
