A web application that focuses primarily on the educational aspects of tax rules which aims to equip our users to be able to file their income tax returns on their own. The primary target audience of our project is mainly startup entrepreneurs, college students, and recent graduates.For this, we provide an extensive documentation section along with interactive quizzes to assess yourself and make the learning process much more interesting. For those who have trouble picking up the lessons all by themselves, we offer free mentor support from verified users. We plan to partner up with startups and local accounting firms for professional support and income tax filing if required
